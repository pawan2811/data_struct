    "Why Must Dictionary Keys Be Immutable?\n",
    "Hashing Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables. When you add a key-value pair to a dictionary, the key is hashed, and this hash is used to determine where the key-value pair is stored.\n",
    "If a key were mutable (i.e., its value could change), then its hash value could change as well. This would make it impossible for Python to find the key in the dictionary, as it would no longer be stored at the location determined by its original hash.\n",
    "Consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutability ensures that the keys in a dictionary remain consistent throughout the lifetime of the dictionary. If keys could change, it would lead to unpredictable behavior and could break the integrity of the data structure.\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable keys guarantee that the hash value remains constant, allowing for fast lookups, inserts, and deletions. Mutable keys would degrade performance since Python would have to rehash the key whenever it was modified, complicating the process and slowing down operations.\n",
